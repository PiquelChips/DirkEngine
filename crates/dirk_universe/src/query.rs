/// A struct to query entities from a [`World`].
///
/// Conditions are evaluated as:
///   - ALL `with_component` types must be present, **and**
///   - NONE of the `without_component` types may be present, **and**
///   - the entity lives in **at least one** of the `with_world` worlds
///     (if any are specified — omitting `with_world` entirely matches all
///     worlds), **and**
///   - the entity does **not** live in any `without_world` world.
///
/// Note: unlike `with_component`, which uses AND across calls, `with_world`
/// uses OR across calls. This means the entity only needs to belong to *one*
/// of the specified worlds to match.
///
/// An empty query matches every entity.
///
/// # Example
/// ```rust
/// # use dirk_universe::components::Component;
/// # use dirk_universe::query::Query;
/// # #[derive(Component, Debug, serde::Deserialize, serde::Serialize)]
/// # struct Position;
/// # #[derive(Component, Debug, serde::Deserialize, serde::Serialize)]
/// # struct Velocity;
/// # #[derive(Component, Debug, serde::Deserialize, serde::Serialize)]
/// # struct Frozen;
/// let query = Query::empty()
///     .with_component::<Position>()
///     .with_component::<Velocity>()
