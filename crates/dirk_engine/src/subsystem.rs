//! Runtime subsystem lifecycle API.
//!
//! Subsystems are objects owned by the engine after [`EngineBuilder`] has
//! finished building the core runtime. They are distinct from plugins: plugins
//! configure the builder, while subsystems are started, ticked, and shut down by
//! the engine loop.
//!
//! Plugins may depend on other plugins by calling
//! [`EngineBuilder::with_plugin`] from [`EnginePlugin::build`]. That call is
//! idempotent by concrete plugin type, so shared dependencies can be requested
//! by every plugin that needs them.
//!
//! Subsystem factories receive an [`EngineBuildContext`]. A factory should
//! publish an [`EngineResource`] when later subsystem factories need a stable,
//! cloneable handle to something the subsystem creates. The subsystem remains
//! the owner of mutable runtime state; resources are build-time discovery
//! handles and may use interior synchronization when shared access is needed.
//!
